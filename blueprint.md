# Online Shop Application Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and features of the Online Shop Flutter application. The application allows users to browse products, view product details, and manage a shopping cart. It leverages Firebase for authentication and a third-party API for product and category data.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Implemented

*   **Product Browsing:** Users can view a list of products with their titles, prices, and thumbnails.
*   **Product Search:** Users can search for products by title.
*   **Category Browsing:** Users can view a list of product categories.
*   **Products by Category:** Users can view products belonging to a specific category.
*   **Product Details:** Users can view detailed information about a product.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Users can add and remove products from their shopping cart.
*   **Splash Screen:** A simple splash screen is displayed on app startup.
*   **Bottom Navigation:** A bottom navigation bar allows users to switch between the product list and category list.
*   **Basic Firebase Authentication:** A basic structure for Firebase email/password authentication was created.

### Current Plan: Auth UI/UX and Error Handling

I will fix bugs in the authentication flow and implement a completely redesigned, visually appealing, and user-friendly UI for the authentication screen.

*   **Error Handling:** The `AuthService` will be updated to properly propagate errors to the UI, and the login screen will display user-friendly error messages in a `SnackBar`.
*   **State Management Fix:** The `LoginScreen` will be corrected to use the shared `AuthService` instance from the `Provider` instead of creating its own.
*   **Loading Indicator:** The UI will display a loading indicator while the app is communicating with Firebase to provide feedback to the user.
*   **Redesigned UI:** The login and sign-up screen will be completely redesigned with a modern aesthetic, including:
    *   A visually appealing layout with a gradient background and a welcoming header.
    *   Use of the `google_fonts` package for improved typography.
    *   `Card` styling for the input form.
    *   Styled buttons with icons and appropriate padding.
    *   `Form` validation for email and password fields to ensure data integrity.
