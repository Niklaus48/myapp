# Online Shop Application Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and features of the Online Shop Flutter application. The application allows users to browse products, view product details, and manage a shopping cart. It leverages Firebase for authentication and a third-party API for product and category data.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Implemented

*   **Product Browsing:** Users can view a list of products with their titles, prices, and thumbnails.
*   **Product Search:** Users can search for products by title.
*   **Category Browsing:** Users can view a list of product categories.
*   **Products by Category:** Users can view products belonging to a specific category.
*   **Product Details:** Users can view detailed information about a product.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Users can add and remove products from their shopping cart.
*   **Splash Screen:** A simple splash screen is displayed on app startup.
*   **Bottom Navigation:** A bottom navigation bar allows users to switch between the product list and category list.

### Current Plan: Firebase Authentication

I will implement a complete authentication system using Firebase Authentication.

*   **Login Screen:** A new screen will be created to allow users to sign in with their email and password.
*   **Registration:** Users will be able to create a new account with their email and password.
*   **Authentication Service:** A dedicated service will be created to handle all Firebase Authentication logic, including sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out.
*   **Navigation Flow:** The application will navigate to the home screen upon successful login and to the login screen upon logout.
*   **Logout Button:** A logout button will be added to the home screen.
